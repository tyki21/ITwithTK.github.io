<h1>Careers Lead you in </h1>
<p>Throughout my college experience I have held quite a few positons. Mostly on-campus jobs and internships,
I use these experiences to build upon what I call my professional self. I have learned quite a bit from each job.
From how to clip a dogs toe-nail to how to install a operation system on a server. Take a look below and explore
my projects and achievements.</p>
