<h1>Hi! TK here!</h1>
<p>Formally know as Tykiera Olive-Stalling.</p>
<p>Big Things to Note:</p>
  <p> I am currently a college student at the Illinois Institute of technology. I gradute this coming fall in December. Most of my time spent
    is working on this website, my blog, and other related projects outside of my regualr work day. Considering that I am only in school during
    at night I would like to have a job that could teach me the ropes of the IT world. During the summer time I do plan to accquiring a few
    certifications if my budget allows (bills are not nice things). At the very least I will have a basic COMPTIA A+ in Hardware by June.
