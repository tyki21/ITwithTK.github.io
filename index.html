<p>I personally go by TK </p>
<p>Big Things to Note:</p>
  <p> I am a alumni of the Illinois Institute of Technology. Most of my time spent is working on this website, my blog, and other
   side projects outside of my regular work day. I do knit and crochet as well and accept small commissions such as: hats, scarves, mittens
  ,etc</p>

<p> In the near future I would like to obtain my Master's Degree in something I find interesting. Right now I read about Web Design, Software Development, and Security.
Not sure which direction I am going to settle on, if I settle on anyone of them at all. Might do all three like I did in my undergrad. I have my specialization in
Web Design and Software Dev. </p>

<p> In the next five to 6 years, I do plan on becoming a Project Manager. I have always been interested in that sort of work. I do great on the field but I like
 looking at the bigger picture and getting those fine details together to make something magical happen. It's not all the time you can do both. Like with knitting
 I do both, knowing that while I am moving one stitch at a time I will have a sweater and one adjustment can make it the best or something I'll have to redo
 down the line. It picks my brain looking for new ways to do things to make everything easier for me and others. It's rewarding.</p>

<p> As of now I am living in Chicago. I was born here and have loved it, but honestly I'm ready to leave the city. It has been great and has given me lots of stories,
 I just need a change on scenery in my particular novel. So I am looking for positions all throughout the states.
 </p>
